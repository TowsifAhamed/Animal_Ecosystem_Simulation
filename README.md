# Animal_Ecosystem_Simulation
An Australian forest ecosystem with trees and water bodies habituated by Echidnas, Koalas and Dingoes, based on different stats and interactions.

The goal of this game is to maximize the generation of wildlife and the interaction between
the animals. In the game three different animals have been used: Echidna, Koala, and Dingo
to show the state of the animals in a closed environment. We have to give input the number of
the each animals in a virtual world which will be simulated afterwards. In a closed
environment, it can be seen that how each animal is interacting with other animals using a
limited energy source from nature. Here the traits of Echidna, Koala, and Dingo will
determine the behavioral pattern of each animal and for how many generations the game will
run. Itâ€™s a turn-based simulation where the state of the animals was updated and simulated.
This study focused on using the actual behavioral pattern of the animals to build the formulas
of their nature. The habitat, foods, movement, reproduction cycle and so on parameters were
investigated to build the simulations for each animal in a constrained environment. In
implementation heuristic search has been used.
